# PowerBI Template Readme

The instructions for configuring the template are below ‚Äì please download the .PBIT file prior to starting the setup process.

## Data Extract Setup (Pre-requisite)
<ol type="1">
<li>Set up and schedule a data extract in your Arena workspace settings 
<ol><li>1x per day is suggested but you can select any recurring period ‚Äì the template file only loads the latest run of Data Extract </li>
<li>Select the Full extract type <b>- NOTE: Full+Delta extracts are not supported by this template since Power BI cannot manage the incremental ETL of delta Arena transactions - it will replace all table contents from the previous refresh each time it refreshes data, thus any Delta refresh will lose the prior Full load's data.</b></li>
<li>Select all available data extract views ‚Äì the queries will handle any views with no data </li></ol></li>
<li>Select either the "DataExtract CSV" or "RFC 4180 CSV" format ‚Äì the queries will handle either format </li></ol></li>

</p>

<li>Starting in Release 2025.2 , there is no longer a DataExtract user profile set up upon creation. You will need to create a machine user profile under Workspace Settings > Employees > Machine Users. For any existing DataExtract setups, the prior DataExtract logins were converted to a Machine User during the release of 2025.2. <b>The Machine User must have the proper Access Policy rules (Read, Edit, Manage DataExtract) to administer DataExtract (or be granted Arena administrator) in order for it to access the DataExtract endpoints in the API.</b> Note the Machine User's email and password you generated, as well as the workspace ID. These will be needed for the setup in Power BI.  </li></ol>

&nbsp;

  <li>Locate the provided ‚ÄúArena Power BI Template[‚Ä¶] .pbit‚Äù file and click Open.</li>
  </ol>
  
<li>On the next dialog box, enter values for the variables according to your workspace:</li>
    <ol><li>Arena API URL (var_api_url) - select the correct REST API URL for either the North America, GovCloud, or Europe API instance (default: North America) <br>
      ‚Ä¢	https://api.arenasolutions.com/v1 (North America)<br>
‚Ä¢	https://api.arenagov.com/v1 (AWS GovCloud)<br>
‚Ä¢	https://api.europe.arenaplm.com/v1 (Europe)</li>
      <li>Arena Email (var_email) - the Machine User's email (see setup in section above)</li>
      <li>Arena Password (var_password) - the Machine User password</li>
      <li>Arena Workspace ID (var_workspace_id) - the Arena workspace ID you want to connect to</li></ol>
      
&nbsp;
<p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/ptc-arena/.github/blob/main/PowerBI_SS3.png" alt="Arena Analytics">
</p>
&nbsp;

<li>A refresh progress box will appear as Power BI connects to Arena REST API and downloads and extracts the CSV data for each of the Data Extract files. <br>
  <b>Note: On the initial connection to the Arena API, you might get a pop-up dialog box that asks you to get the permission level for the connection. 
  Make sure you select ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù for the Authentication Type, and select ‚ÄúOrganizational‚Äù for the Privacy Level.</b> Click OK to continue. </li>

</p>
&nbsp;

<li>Once the refresh progress box disappears, the sample reports will be populated with data from the Arena workspace.</li>

&nbsp;

<li>The Power BI developer can then review and tweak anything in the file (reports, charts, fields, filters, etc.) and then save the result to their own .PBIX file (via File > Save As).</li>

<li>(Optional) If there are any changes to the Data Extract service or to load fresh data updates that happen in Arena, 
  the user can run the Refresh button on the top of the Home tab at any time. The process will run similar to the initial query in Step 4.</li>

## üëã Frequently Asked Questions
Q: I got an error during the initial setup regarding One to Many relationships, what should I do?<br>
A: While we make every attempt to test our Arena template file in many different types of customer workspaces, there may be an issue where there is one or more duplicate rows that are linked between tables. Typically, the predefined relationships help to link different tables/reports when a user selects a metric in a report. 
To address this, review the error details in the refresh dialog box, noting the table and the column that is specified. Open the ‚ÄòManage Relationships‚Äô menu in Power BI and delete the relationship rows that correspond to that table and column. Once you delete these rows, close and try to refresh data again.
<br><br>

Q: I got a pop-up that asks for permissions for the Arena URL, what should I do?<br>
A: It can happen on the initial connection within Power BI and will be saved for future refreshes of the data. Make sure you select ‚ÄúAnonymous‚Äù for the Type, and select ‚ÄúOrganizational‚Äù for the Privacy Level. Click OK to continue.
<br> <br>
Q: I still need help, what should I do?<br>
A: Please contact your Arena Account Manager, Customer Success Coach, or Arena Support and we‚Äôll gladly review your connection issue and get your Power BI environment loaded with your Arena data.
